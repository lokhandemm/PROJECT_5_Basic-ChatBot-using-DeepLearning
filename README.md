# ðŸ¤– Basic ChatBot using Deep Learning  
 
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project is a **Deep Learning-based ChatBot** that uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to understand and respond to user queries.   

The chatbot is trained on a structured dataset of conversational intents and can recognize user input patterns, classify them into predefined categories, and generate appropriate responses.  

The chatbot employs a **Neural Network (LSTM/RNN-based model)** for text classification and intent recognition.     
 
The goal is to create an interactive AI assistant capable of carrying out simple conversations based on predefined responses.
